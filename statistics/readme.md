# Here's a collection of notebooks put together that gathers ways to do statistics operations in Python

## `bayes_book_notes`
Building out this notebook as I read *Baysean Statistics the Fun Way* by Will Kurt. Contains:  
- My solutions to chapter end exercises, when code is useful or requried
- Translations of R code into Python, and breakdowns of R function equivalents in Python, usually using `scipy.stats`
- Recreations of the book's visualizations using Python.
